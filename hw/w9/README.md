Explanation Tax:
Explanation tax refers to the compromises we encounter when simplifying complex data into manageable rules for explanations or decision-making. Consider the rule "Model < 71 and origin == 2 or origin == 3 and 71 <= Volume < 110" filters a segment of data into a concise information. However, this simplification skims over finer details and exceptions that might be critical for a deeper understanding or more precise predictions. Essentially, while such rules enhance ability to understand and apply, they do so at the cost of potentially overlooking nuanced data insights. Thus, the "explanation tax" serves as a reminder of the limitations we face when we try to streamline complex information into more digestible formats, cautioning against the potential loss of valuable insights in the process.
