# Week 6

Outputs in form of clusters are generated.

To get clusters working, we implemented the NODE.py file which has walk and show as methods which is responsible for creating nodes and finding the nearest node with distance using the d2h as distance to heaven. 

We implemented the doubletap, tree and branch methods which are collectively responsible for generating the tree and performing Recursive Random Projections
