# Week 5

We got the Distance and Far working.

To get Distance working, we implemented neighbor and distance methods in ROW and the distance method in both NUM and SYM. Additionally, we added dist method in GATE.py that produces outpot that gives every 30th row and distance from that row to the first row.

To get Far working, we used the neighbor method in ROW and implemented farapart method in DATA. Additionally, we implemented far method in GATE.py which finds and prints two points that are 0.95 distance far from each other.
