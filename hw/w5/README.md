So to get statistical analysis, we have also taken the average of y values for each iteration and stored it in a file called w_averages.out. This file is used to get the statistical analysis of the data. while w.out represent the normal  output of the code.

Based on the statistical analysis conducted within the provided code, SMO demonstrates clear superiority over the random baselines across the specified metrics of lbs, acc, and mpg.

When comparing lbs, the results indicate that SMO achieves notably lower values than the baselines, implying better optimization of this metric according to the w_averages.out averages. Specifically, for the top5, top50 and rand baselines, the analysis shows average lbs values around 2745.3665, 2897.684, and 2962.4355 respectively over 20 iterations. In contrast, the SMO method yields an average lbs of approximately 2357.4472, markedly outperforming the baselines.

Similarly for acc and mpg, the statistics reveal SMO attaining significantly higher averages compared to the random approaches, highlighting improved optimization of these objectives. While the top5, top50 and rand baselines achieve acc averages around 16.113, 15.7555, and 15.5665, SMO reaches 16.5411, surpassing all three. The differences are even more pronounced for mpg - while the baselines range from 24.2595 to 25.233, SMO accomplishes a 28.9972 average, notably exceeding the alternatives.

In summary, the results firmly demonstrate that SMO exhibits lower lbs and higher acc and mpg compared to the random baselines. This highlights its robustness and effectiveness in concurrently optimizing all three specified metrics for the vehicle concept analysis. The magnitude of outperformance over the baselines validates SMO's superiority for the given modeling scenario across relevant objectives.
